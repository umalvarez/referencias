  abstract =     {We reviewed 53 patients with infection stones treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) monotherapy to determine the long-term rate free of stones and the stone recurrence rate as correlated with the pre-treatment stone burden and the radiological presence of sand or fragments after the procedure. Long-term followup (mean 26.6 months) was available on 33 patients representing 38 kidneys. Although only 3 kidneys were free of stones immediately after ESWL, 20 were without stones at 3 months and 18 (47\%) were stone-free at followup. Of 9 kidneys with fragments of more than 5 mm. after the final treatment 7 (78\%) had residual fragments at 3 months and experienced stone progression. Of 9 kidneys with sand remaining 6 (66\%) and all 3 kidneys that appeared to be free of stones after ESWL were without stones at followup. The 3-month plain film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder was a reliable indicator of eventual outcome. Of 20 kidneys that were free of stones at 3 months 16 remained without stones. Of 18 kidneys with residual stone particles at 3 months 14 showed disease progression, 2 had stable disease and 2 passed residual sand. Only 1 of 17 patients who were free of stones or had stable stone disease had a positive urine culture at followup. Patients with infection stone fragments 3 months after ESWL monotherapy have a high rate of stone progression (78\%) and should undergo further treatment. ESWL monotherapy of infection stones requires close patient followup to assure that all residual fragments have passed and urine remains sterile.},

In 96\% of 60 dogs with surgically implanted renal pelvic stones, the fragments were discharged in the urine. The same effect was achieved in 20 out of 21 patients with renal pelvic stones. In the twenty-first patient, a staghorn calculus was broken up to facilitate surgical removal. 2 patients with upper ureteric stones also received shock waves, but their stones had to be removed surgically; in 1 of these the stone had been embedded in the ureteric wall by connective tissue. The procedure can in many cases be done under epidural instead of general anaesthesia. Side-effects consisted of slight haematuria and, occasionally, of easily treatable ureteric colic. They were probably due to passage of fragments down the ureter. Disintergration of kidney stones by shock waves seems to be a promising form of treatment that reduces the need for surgery.},

Two methods for the estimation of μmax from turbidemetric data are presented. One is based on absorbance and the other on transmittance measurements. Both are compared to estimates obtained by viable count methods. Calibration factors, a function to correct the non-linearity of absorbance measurements, and variance stabilising transformations for corrected absorbance measurements and for viable count data, are determined. It is concluded that turbidimetric measurements may be used reliably for estimation of μmax."

Twenty-two branched renal calculi from 6 patients were cultured. Fifteen calculi were infected with 1 or more urease-producing gram-negative enteric bacterium, 2 were infected with a urease-producing bacterium and a nonurease-producing organism, and 5 were sterile. Immersion of infected stones in antimicrobial solutions before culture reduced or eliminated surface bacteria but usually did not eradicate bacteria within the stone. The bacteriology of a stone or stones could be predicted on the basis of available urine culture results in only 2 of the 16 cases. These data suggest that branched renal calculi associated with bacteriuria usually are infected but that documentation of infection and identification of the infecting organism require culture of the stone.},

We adapted the Fricke ferrous sulfate radiation dosimeter to examine the chemical effects of high energy shock waves. Significant free radical production was documented. The reaction was dose dependent, predictably increased by acoustic impedance, but curvilinear. A thousand shocks at 18 kilovolts induced the same free radical oxidation as 1100 rad cobalt-60 gamma ionizing irradiation, increasing to 2900 rad in the presence of an air-fluid zone of acoustic impedance. The biological effect of these free radicals was compared to that of cobalt-60 ionizing irradiation by measuring the affect on Chinese hamster cells by clonogenic assay. While cobalt-60 irradiation produced a marked decrease in clonogenic survivors, little effect was noted with high energy shock waves. This suggested that the chemical effects produced by shock waves were either absent or attenuated in the cells, or were inherently less toxic than those of ionizing irradiation.},

Several attempts at an early-theory quickly collapsed for lack of foundations in mathematics and thermodynamics. It is not until the works of Rankine and later Hugoniot that a full theory is established. Rankine is the first to show that within the shock a non-adiabatic process must occur. Hugoniot showed that in the absence of viscosity and heat conduction conservation of energy implies conservation of entropy in smooth regions and a jump in entropy across a shock. Even after the theory is fully developed, old notions continue to pervade the literature well into the early part of the twentieth century.},
